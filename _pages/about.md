I am Samuel Schmidgall, a Robotics Scientist @ Space Robotics 
Deptartment at 
the US Naval Resesarch Laboratory focusing on Robotic Learning for 
Quadrupedal Locomotion and PhD in Electrical and Computer 
Engineering (conc. Robotic & Controls) @ George Mason University focusing 
on meta- and online-learning for embodied systems (e.g. robotic systems). 



For additional information see my [CV](https://github.com/SamuelSchmidgall/SamuelSchmidgall.github.io/blob/master/_data/SamuelSchmidgallCV.pdf).
